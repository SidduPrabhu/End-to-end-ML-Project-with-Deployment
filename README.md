# Project Description:
Developed an end-to-end machine learning project leveraging real estate data to create a web application aimed at providing comprehensive insights and predictions for potential property buyers and sellers.

**Key Points:**

**Data Acquisition and Scraping:**
Gathered real estate data from multiple online sources through web scraping techniques to ensure a diverse and comprehensive dataset.

**Business Planning and Strategy:**
Formulated business plans and strategies to define project objectives and target audience, ensuring alignment with stakeholder requirements.

**Data Preprocessing and Cleaning:**
Conducted extensive preprocessing and cleaning of the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies, ensuring data quality and integrity.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
Performed in-depth exploratory data analysis to uncover trends, patterns, and correlations in the real estate data, providing valuable insights for decision-making.

**Feature Engineering and Selection:**
* Engineered relevant features from the raw data to enhance model performance and interpretability.
* Utilized feature selection techniques to identify the most influential variables for price prediction.

**Model Building and Evaluation:**
* Developed machine learning models, including regression algorithms, to predict real estate prices based on user-provided information.
* Evaluated model performance using appropriate metrics and techniques, such as cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.

**Web Application Development:**
* Built a user-friendly web application using Streamlit to showcase the predictive model and provide interactive visualizations for data analytics.
* Implemented multiple pages within the web application, including price prediction, analytics dashboard, and property recommendation functionality.

**User Interaction and Recommendations:**

* Designed the first page of the web application to enable users to input property details and receive predicted price estimates based on machine learning models.
* Developed the second page to offer various analytics and insights through interactive visualization plots, enhancing user engagement and understanding.
* Implemented the third page to provide personalized property recommendations based on user-selected preferences and similar property features.
